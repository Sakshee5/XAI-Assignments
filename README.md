## Overview
This notebook showcases the use of three interpretable machine learning algorithms from the imodels library. The chosen algorithms are applied to classification and regression datasets respectively to showcase how they work and to provide insights into their interpretability.

## Usage
Open in Colab

## Chosen Algorithms
The following algorithms were selected from the imodels library:

Algorithm 1: BoostedRulesClassifier()

Algorithm 2: GreedyRuleListClassifier()

Algorithm 3: RuleFitRegressor()

Each algorithm is demonstrated on the dataset, with explanations and visual representations of how they work.

## Dataset
#### Dataset for Regression
